Hi! My name is Kamil Piziak, and this is my Github Repository! I am interested in game development, web development, software, and problem solving!
My current projects consist of the following:
- A Japanese Learning Website (W.I.P)
- A space-shooting game. (Created using C#)
- A 2D Platforming game. (Created using C#)
- A Roblox Game using Lua.
- A website displaying the effects of COVID-19 on the homeless population.
- A "template" website displaying what I have learned so far.
